- A weather app using API (Application Programming Interface) can provide users with up-to-date weather information for their current location or any other location around the world.
- The app would use an API to fetch weather data from a weather service provider, such as OpenWeatherMap or AccuWeather, and display the information to the user in a user-friendly format.
## Some key features of a weather app using API may include:
- Current weather conditions: The app can display current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction, precipitation, and more.
- Weather forecast: The app can provide users with a 5-day weather forecast for their location or any other location they search for.
